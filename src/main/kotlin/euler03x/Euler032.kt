Pandigital products
Problem 32
We shall say that an n-digit number is pandigital if it makes use of all the digits 1 to n exactly once; for example, the 5-digit number, 15234, is 1 through 5 pandigital.

The product 7254 is unusual, as the identity, 39 Ã— 186 = 7254, containing multiplicand, multiplier, and product is 1 through 9 pandigital.

Find the sum of all products whose multiplicand/multiplier/product identity can be written as a 1 through 9 pandigital.

HINT: Some products can be obtained in more than one way so be sure to only include it once in your sum.

    98 * 76 = 7448, so both numbers can't be two digits (only 8 characters)
    123 * 456 = 56088, so both numbers can't be three digits (11 characters)
    9 * 876 = 7884 976 * 8 = 7808, so 1 digit * 3 digits won't work
    1234 * 5 = 6170 OK

    so must be 2 digit * 3 digits and 1 digit * 4 digits
    brute forcing seems easier than doing all permutations of (1..9)
