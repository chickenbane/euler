8 char.toInt, again in 16
10 prime numbers
11 .run { }, by lazy delegates, IntArray() { } builder, 2d array, wanted to reuse a habit from scala to flatMap(Option) but learned to love filterNotNull
14 good things to know about comparing IntArray
15 overflowed a long! factorial, P(n,k) C(n,k).
16 number -> string -> List<Char> -> List<Int>: char.toInt() doesn't do what you want
17 build an arrayList with .apply { }
18 stringTo2dArray(), companion object for 67
19 enum classes, you can't put them in the Euler object and import them
20 sum of digits again, now reusable
21 find divisors

67 wanted to read the file by name in classpath, this was the easiest way
