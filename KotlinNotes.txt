5 find prime factors
8 char.toInt, again in 16
10 prime numbers
11 .run { }, by lazy delegates, IntArray() { } builder, 2d array, wanted to reuse a habit from scala to flatMap(Option) but learned to love filterNotNull
12 find divisors of a number
14 good things to know about comparing IntArray
15 overflowed a long! factorial, P(n,k) C(n,k).
16 number -> string -> List<Char> -> List<Int>: char.toInt() doesn't do what you want
17 build an arrayList with .apply { }
18 stringTo2dArray(), companion object for 67
19 enum classes, you can't put them in the Euler object and import them
20 sum of digits again, now reusable
21 find divisors, so reuse #12, gotcha using IntArray(n) { lambda } constructor

67 wanted to read the file by name in classpath, this was the easiest way
